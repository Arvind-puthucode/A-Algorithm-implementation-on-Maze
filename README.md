# A-Algorithm-implementation-on-Maze
This project is an implementation of A* algorithm and its comparison to other search algorithms using the heuristic function
The project contains a .py which implements the maze using the pygames module which opens a window with grids 
The first click on a pixel on the window selects the Source/Starting Point
The second click on another pixel on the window selects the Destination/Ending Point
The remaning clicks or drags on pixels will be black indicating Blockage of Path
Pressing another key on the keyboard for eg Space Bar will Start the Algorithm and the path will be highlighted
